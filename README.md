# Python pandas:

- import of data in csv, xlsx, html, json and txt examples
- filters type, reorders indexes
- data series/data frames from tuples, dictionaries and lists
- concat data frames
- filter and sort dataframe, export data
- dataframe selection
- treatment of missing data
- series interpolation
- aggregate new calculated columns to a data frame
- removing columns from a data frame
- frequency distribution
- descriptive statistics extracting the count / mean / std / min / 25% / 50% / 75% / max from a dataframe
- plot using matplotlib.pyplot (boxplot, histogram, scatterplot)
- creates value ranges by cutting dataframes
- identify and removes outliers

# Statistics

    - Frequencies and measurements
            - FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
                - Frequency distribution for qualitative variables
                - Frequency distribution for quantitative variables (custom classes)
                - Creation of frequency distributions with pandas `value_counts()`, `crosstab()` and  with custom classes, using the `value_counts()` and `cut()` functions together.
                - Use of Sturges rule to obtain an optimal number of classes for a given sample size.
                - Plot the histograms with pandas and seaborn
            - Mean, median and mode
                - Calculates the main measures of central tendency: arithmetic mean, median and mode.
                - Indentifies important characteristics of a distribution, such as the presence of asymmetry and its direction from the relationship between measures of central tendency.
            - Measures of position
                - Obtainment of quartiles, deciles and percentiles of a distribution
                - Building and interpreting a boxplot, using quartiles
            - Dispersion measures
                - Obtainment three important dispersion measures. The mean absolute deviation, the variance and the standard deviation.
